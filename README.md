# Machine-Learning
Hello this is my submital for the coursera machine learning course.
The git should contain the HTML files as well as the models generated by r.

The models have been included as they are computationally intensive i.e. one in particular took hours to create.
The first part of the file name is the model and the second is the seed used to create it.
